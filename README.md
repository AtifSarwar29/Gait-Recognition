# Gait-Recog
It is the project of gait recognition
Human recognition methods , such as fingerprints,face,or iris biometric
modalities,generally reguire a cooperative subject, views from certain aspects,and physical contact or close proximity
These methods cannot rliably recognize noncooperating individuals at a distance in real world under changing environmental
conditions.Gait,which concerns recognizing individuals by the way they walk.
>>Gait Energy Image (GEI), to characterize human walking properties for individual recognition by gait.  Real templates are computed from training silhouette sequences, while  generate the synthetic templates from training sequences by simulating silhouette distortion.
